# Basic Info
## Current status: very WIP.
The goal of this project is to visualize data about people's impressions of
various linux distributions using data gathered from distrowatch.org

At this point I'm trying to decide if I'll keep struggling to scrape data with
javascript or if I'll switch to python. At some point, I would like to build
this tool in Javascript, Python, and Pharos, just for the exercise. Right now
the goal is to get a self-updating website up.
